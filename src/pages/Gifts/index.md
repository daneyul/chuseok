<h2 class="blog-header--2">Fun Fact</h2>
<p class="blog-p">
In a recent effort to curb corruption and bribery, an anti-corruption law has been enacted that caps the prices of Chuseok gift sets. This law places restrictions on the amount of money public officials in civil service, media, or education sectors can spend and accept. Specifically, the law stipulates a ₩30,000 limit on meals, a ₩50,000 limit on gifts, and a ₩100,000 limit on cash that public officials can accept at closed events.
