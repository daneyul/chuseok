Did you know that folklore related to the moon is a common theme in Mid-Autumn harvest festivals around the world? In Korea, when you gaze up at the full moon, you might see the silhouette of a rabbit making rice cakes. But what's the story behind this celestial rabbit?
</p>

<h2 class="blog-header--2">Historical Context</h2>
<p class="blog-p">
Believed to have originated from the Jataka tales of Buddhist scriptures, the Moon Rabbit's self-sacrifice to feed the starving old man—later revealed to be the celestial deity, Śakra—represents the Buddhist virtues of selflessness and compassion. This narrative entered Korea as early as the 4th century during the Three Kingdoms period, with the advent of Buddhism.

The Moon Rabbit is not an exclusively Korean phenomenon.

While the Moon Rabbit may seem like a mere fable from the past, its influence is still perceptible in modern Korea. For instance, during the Mid-Autumn festival, a time when the moon is at its fullest, families come together to make songpyeon (a type of rice cake), a ritual that harkens back to the rice cake-pounding rabbit on the moon.
