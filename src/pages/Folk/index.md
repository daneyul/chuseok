<h2 class="blog-header--2 mt-5">Ganggangsullae 강강술래</h2>
<p>
Ganggangsullae is the quintessential folk activity performed during the full moon of Chuseok, showcasing Korea’s agrarian roots. This 5,000-year-old dance, recognized by UNESCO as a “seasonal harvest and fertility ritual,” provides a glimpse into rural Korean life. Participants, dressed in traditional hanbok, form a circle and hold hands, playfully mimicking vignettes of rural life while repeating the name of the dance. Today, Ganggangsullae is preserved as a performing art and is taught in elementary schools across the country.

Teams participating in this game are usually divided by gender or region.
